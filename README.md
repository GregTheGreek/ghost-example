# selfhostedshow/ghost-example

This repo contains a couple of example files so that you can get up and running with a self-hosted Ghost blog using Docker in a matter of minutes.

This resource is a companion to [Self Hosted episode 4](https://selfhosted.show/4).

Utilise the docker-compose.yaml file with `docker-compose up -d` and install the nginx config file in your sites-confs directory. Full guides available on [blog.linuxserver.io](https://blog.linuxserver.io) along with a PUID and PGID explanation too.
